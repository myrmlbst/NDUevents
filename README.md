# NDUevents
This webapp was made to host a chatbot that recieves questions from the end user about upcoming events at NDU, scrapes data from the NDU website, and returns answers accordingly. As the social media manager of NDU's Computer Club, I made this website in 2024 to assist me with planning ahead for upcoming events that needed to be mentioned on our social media.

**This chatbot can be customized to be implemented in any website, including WordPress websites.**
